By using the Service in any way, you are agreeing to comply with the TOU. In addition, when using particular ACDN services, you agree to abide by any applicable posted guidelines for ACDN services, which may change from time to time. Should you object to any term or condition of the TOU, any guidelines, or any subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with the Service in any way, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of the Service.</dd>

            <dt>2) Modifications to this agreement</dt>
            <dd>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter these terms and conditions at any time. Such modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. You must review this agreement on a regular basis to keep yourself apprised of any changes.</dd>

            <dt>3) Eligibility for use</dt>
            <dd>ACDN reserves some parts of the Service exclusively for professional purchasers, sellers, collectors and resellers of items and accessories who are acceptable to ACDN in its sole discretion. Although ACDN attempts to limit the use of these parts of the Service to such purchasers, sellers, collectors and resellers of items and accessories, nothing herein shall create any right of action against ACDN for failing to adequately screen potential users or prevent the use of ACDN or the Service by users who are not professional purchasers, sellers, collectors and resellers of items or accessories.</dd>

            <dt>4) Content</dt>
            <dd>You understand that all advertisements, postings, messages, text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, or other materials (“Content”) posted on, transmitted through, or linked from the Service are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. More specifically, you are entirely responsible for each individual item of Content that you post, email or otherwise make available via the Service. Likewise, if you request the assistance of ACDN to post content, or if you imply consent that ACDN may post content on your behalf, either by written or oral means, or you fail to inform ACDN that content should be removed, you are equally responsible for the content. You waive any and all claims against ACDN of a right of publicity for your image or likeness throughout the world by posting any information or pictures of yourself on ACDN. You understand that ACDN does not control, and is not responsible for personal Content made available through the Service, and that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise objectionable. When you post User Content to the Service, you authorize and direct us to make such copies thereof as we deem necessary in order to facilitate the posting and storage of the Content on the Service. By posting Content to any part of the Service, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to the Company an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such Content for any purpose on or in connection with the Service or the promotion thereof, to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses of the foregoing. Furthermore, ACDN and Content available through the Service may contain links to other websites, which are completely independent of ACDN. ACDN makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of the information contained in any such site. Following links to any other websites is at your own risk. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, that you may not rely on said Content, and that under no circumstances will ACDN be liable in any way for any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise made available via the Service. You acknowledge that ACDN does not pre-screen or approve Content, but that ACDN shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse, delete or move any Content that is available via the Service, for violating the letter or spirit of the TOU or for any other reason.</dd>

            <dt>5) Third party content, sites, and services</dt>

Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Service, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. We do not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of, any Content, the truth or accuracy of the descriptions of any goods or services offered for sale, the right of the sellers to sell or license any such goods or services, or the ability of any buyer to purchase any such goods or services. The Service is designed for experienced buyers accustomed to buying goods and services based on photographs and/or descriptive text. Buyers should assume that any goods offered are not new, unless otherwise stated, nor in perfect condition, and may require touch-up or repairs prior to use and that the available information about the items may be limited. It is not possible for ACDN to verify information provided by the seller of any item.</dd>
            <dd>You agree that ACDN shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any dealings between users of the Service.

            <dt>9) Posting agents</dt>
            <dd>A “Posting Agent” is a third-party agent, service, or intermediary that offers to post Content to the Service on behalf of others. To moderate demands on ACDN’s resources, you may not use a Posting Agent to post Content to the Service without express permission or license from ACDN. Correspondingly, Posting Agents are not permitted to post Content on behalf of others, to cause Content to be so posted, or otherwise access the Service to facilitate posting Content on behalf of others, except with express permission or license from ACDN.</dd>

            <dt>10) No spam policy</dt>
            <dd>You understand and agree that sending unsolicited email advertisements to ACDN email addresses or through ACDN computer systems is expressly prohibited by these TOU. Any unauthorized use of ACDN computer systems is a violation of the TOU and certain federal and state laws, including without limitation the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. § 1030 et seq.). Such violations may subject the sender and his or her agents to civil and criminal penalties.</dd>

            <dt>11) Paid postings</dt>
            <dd>We may charge a fee to post Content in some areas of the Service. The fee is an access fee permitting Content to be posted in a designated area. Each party posting Content to the Service is responsible for said Content and compliance with the TOU. All fees paid will be non-refundable in the event that Content is removed from the Service for violating the TOU. Fees collected for specific services, such as subscription services and advertising, are non-refundable unless otherwise stated in writing for a specific promotional program.</dd>

            <dt>12) Limitations on service</dt>
            <dd>You acknowledge that ACDN may establish limits concerning use of the Service, including the maximum number of days that Content will be retained by the Service, the maximum number and size of postings, email messages, or other Content that may be transmitted or stored by the Service, and the frequency with which you may access the Service. You agree that ACDN has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Content maintained or transmitted by the Service. You acknowledge that ACDN reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice, and that ACDN shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.</dd>

            <dd>ACDN grants you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access the Service for your own personal use. This license does not include: (a) access to the Service by Posting Agents; or (b) any collection, aggregation, copying, duplication, display or derivative use of the Service nor any use of data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and extraction tools for any purpose unless expressly permitted by aged care development network. A limited exception to (b) is provided to general purpose internet search engines and non-commercial public archives that use such tools to gather information for the sole purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Service, provided they each do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses using an easily identifiable agent and comply with our robots.txt file. “General purpose internet search engine” does not include a website or search engine or other service that specializes in classified listings or in any subset of classifieds listings such as decorative goods or furniture, or which is in the business of providing classified ad listing services.</dd>
            <dd>ACDN does not permit you to display on your website, or create a hyperlink on your website to, individual postings on the Service, absent express permission granted by aged care development network to do so. You may create a hyperlink to the home page of aged care development network, so long as the link does not portray aged care development network, its employees, or its affiliates in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter.</dd>
            <dd>ACDN may offer various parts of the Service in RSS format so that users can embed individual feeds into a personal website or blog, or view postings through third party software news aggregator. ACDN permits you to display, excerpt from, and link to the RSS feeds on your personal website or personal web blog, provided that (a) your use of the RSS feed is for personal, non-commercial purposes only, (b) each title is correctly linked back to the original post on the Service and redirects the user to the post when the user clicks on it, (c) you provide, adjacent to the RSS feed, proper attribution to “ACDN” as the source, (d) your use or display does not suggest that ACDN promotes or endorses any third party causes, ideas, web sites, products or services, (e) you do not redistribute the RSS feed, and (f) your use does not overburden ACDN’s systems. ACDN reserves all rights in the content of the RSS feeds and may terminate any RSS feed at any time.</dd>
            <dd>Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access granted to you by ACDN immediately terminates said permission or license. In order to collect, aggregate, copy, duplicate, display or make derivative use of the Service or any Content made available via the Service for other purposes (including commercial purposes) not stated herein, you must first obtain a written license from aged care development network that has been signed by one of ACDN’s authorized representatives.</dd>

Further, you agree that ACDN shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service. Further, you agree not to attempt to use the Service after said termination. Sections 2-7 and 13-20 shall survive termination of the TOU.</dd>

            <dt>15) Proprietary rights</dt>
            <dd>The Service is protected to the maximum extent permitted by copyright laws and international treaties.

You are not authorized to use any such Marks. Ownership of all such Marks and the goodwill associate therewith remains with ACDN or those other entities.</dd>
            <dd>Although ACDN does not claim ownership of content that its users post, by posting Content to any public area of the Service, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to ACDN an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid, worldwide license to use, copy, perform, display, and distribute said Content and to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, said Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses (through multiple tiers) of the foregoing. Furthermore, by posting Content to any public area of the Service, you automatically grant ACDN all rights necessary to prohibit any subsequent aggregation, display, copying, duplication, reproduction, or exploitation of the Content on the Service by any party for any purpose.</dd>

            <dt>16) Disclaimer of warranties</dt>
            <dd>YOU AGREE THAT USE OF ACDN AND THE SERVICE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. ACDN AND THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” OR “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ACDN DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES FOR VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS IN CONNECTION WITH ACDN OR THE SERVICE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM ACDN OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties. In such jurisdictions, some of the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you insofar as they relate to implied warranties.</dd>

            <dt>17) Limitations of liability</dt>
            <dd>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL ACDN BE LIABLE FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (EVEN IF ACDN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM ANY ASPECT OF YOUR USE OF ACDN OR THE SERVICE, WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE FROM USE OR MISUSE OF ACDN OR THE SERVICE, FROM INABILITY TO USE ACDN OR THE SERVICE, OR THE INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, MODIFICATION, ALTERATION, OR TERMINATION OF ACDN OR THE SERVICE.

            <dt>18) Indemnity</dt>
            <dd>You agree to indemnify and hold ACDN, its officers, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, directors, officers, agents, service providers, suppliers and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorney fees and court costs, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post or make available through the Service, your use of the Service, your violation of the TOU, your breach of any of the representations and warranties herein, or your violation of any rights of another.</dd>

            <dt>19) General information</dt>
            <dd>The TOU, and any additional terms to which you agree when using particular elements of the Service, constitutes the entire agreement between you and ACDN and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreement between you and ACDN. The failure of ACDN to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOU is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOU remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</dd>

            <dd>You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to quantify, if it becomes necessary for ACDN to pursue legal action to enforce the TOU, you will be liable to pay ACDN the following amounts as liquidated damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of ACDN’s damages for the specified breaches of the TOU:</dd>
            <ul>
                <li>If you post a message that (i) impersonates any person or entity; (ii) falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity; or (iii) that includes personal or identifying information about another person without that person’s explicit consent, you agree to pay ACDN one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each such message. This provision does not apply to messages that are lawful non-deceptive parodies of public figures.</li>
                <li>If ACDN establishes limits on the frequency with which you may access the Service, or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you agree to pay ACDN one hundred dollars ($100) for each message posted in excess of such limits or for each day on which you access ACDN in excess of such limits, whichever is higher.</li>

A Posting Agent will also be deemed an agent of the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service (the “Principal”), and the Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent in violation of the TOU) agrees to pay ACDN an additional one hundred dollars ($100) for each item of Content posted by the Posting Agent on behalf of the principal in violation of the TOU.</li>
                <li>If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in violation of the TOU without ACDN’s express written permission, you agree to pay ACDN three thousand dollars ($3,000) for each day on which you engage in such conduct.</li>
            </ul>
            <dd>Notwithstanding any other provision of the TOU, ACDN retains the right to seek the remedy of specific performance of any term contained in the TOU, or a preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the TOU, or to seek to recover damages arising from or relating to a violation of this TOU or any combination thereof.</dd>
